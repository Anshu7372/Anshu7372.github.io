# Sadashiv Kumar Portfolio

Personal portfolio built with Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Contact Form / Google Drive Setup

The contact form can save messages into the Google Drive account `sadashivkumar32@gmail.com` through a Google Apps Script web app. Deploy an Apps Script web app that writes each POST body into a Google Sheet or Drive file, then set this environment variable before building:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEBHOOK_URL="your_apps_script_web_app_url"
```

Without this environment variable, the form falls back to opening an email draft.
